Makai Rental Solutions seeks to provide a streamlined self-service rental process that users can navigate without the need of on-site staff. The individual location owners are able to manage stand conditions and revenue offsite. Makai Rentals is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the Emergency Contacts feature.
